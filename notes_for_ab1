Run different inputs from Python

Modify /PHOTOCHEM/INPUTFILES/species.dat
Potentially modify /PHOTOCHEM/INPUTFILES/PLANET.dat
To help with convergence, potentially replace /PHOTOCHEM/in.dist with a /PHOTOCHEM/PUTPUT/out.dist from another run

./Photo.run

Check for convergence:
check in /PHOTOCHEM/OUTPUT/out.out for max N = (number)
if number < 10k: converged



Modify /CLIMA/IO/TEMPLATES/ModernEarth/input_clima.dat to /CLIMA/IO (this includes NSTEPS=    (number)) to change the number of steps

To help with convergence, potentially replace /CLIMA/IO/TempIn.dat with /CLIMA/IO/TempOut.dat
Also set IUP=       0 in /CLIMA/IO/input_clima.dat



if converged:
./Clima.run



Save the following as output:
/PHOTOCHEM/OUTPUT/out.dist
/PHOTOCHEM/OUTPUT/out.out
/CLIMA/IO/clima_allout.tab
