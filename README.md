# pyatmos

A Docker image for [Atmos](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos) and a Python package for interacting with Atmos, for NASA FDL 2018 astrobiology challenges.

Development by William Fawcett, Rodd Talebi, Aaron Bell and Aditya Chopra, with some initial work by Adam Cobb and Atilim Gunes Baydin.


## How to install

You can clone this repository and install the `pyatmos` package. You need to have Docker installed in your system.

The Python package pulls the latest Docker image for atmos from the FDL GitLab registry, here: https://gitlab.com/frontierdevelopmentlab/astrobiology/pyatmos/container_registry



### Prerequisites
If you are using Ububtu (or similar), make sure python and pip are installed:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python python-dev python3 python3-dev
    sudo apt install pip


Make sure docker is installed:
    
    # install docker, either install [Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) for your system
    # or, from the command line:  
    sudo apt install docker.io

    # You may need to add yourself to the "docker group" so you have the correct permissions 
    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER 

    # Test that you can access docker (you may need to restart the machine first if this does not work)
    docker run hello-world

### Install the package

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PyAtmos/PyAtmos.git
cd PyAtmos
pip install -e .
```

Note that this version of PyAtmos clones the original ATMOS code, but that ATMOS version dates back to when this package was first developed in 2018. 
If there are updates to ATMOS that you need, then you can clone ATMOS locally and link PyAtmos to that. 

###Â Testing the package

Navigate to the test directory, and run `simple_run.py`:
```
cd tests
python3 simple_run.py
```
This should check out the docker image from the gitlab registry and run this on your machine. 
Inside `simple_run.py` see how the arguments to the `Simulaton` and `run` functions are called, you can then modify these to point to either your own docker image, or a local version of ATMOS on your own computer.

## Docker on google cloud

To setup the docker image on the google cloud:

    # build the docker image, tag it, and upload to repository 
    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/i-agility-205814/pyatmos .

    # you may need to authenticate, if so, do 
    gcloud auth configure-docker
    gcloud auth login
  

## Auxiliary information

### Seting up docker on google cloud 

To upload your docker image to the google cloud, create your docker file as normal and build it. In this example the docker image will be called quickstart-image:
    
    # build the docker image 
    docker build -t quickstart-image .

    # tag it
    docker tag quickstart-image gcr.io/i-agility-205814/quickstart-image:tag1

Note that here, `i-agility-205814` is the google cloud Project ID [projectid]. tag1 is the name of the tag applied to the docker image. Now push the docker image to the docker container registry:

    docker push gcr.io/i-agility-205814/quickstart-image:tag1

You may need to make sure that you have the right credentials if this fails, see: https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication 
Since this is a test, you can delete the docker image:

    gcloud container images delete gcr.io/i-agility-205814/quickstart-image:tag1 --force-delete-tags
