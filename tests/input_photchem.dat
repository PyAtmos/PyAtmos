C ***** SET MODEL PARAMETERS *****
C     AGL = DIURNAL AVERAGING FACTOR FOR PHOTORATES
C     ISEASON = TELLS WHETHER P AND T VARY WITH TIME (THEY DON'T FOR
C               ISEASON < 3)
C     IZYO2 = TELLS WHETHER SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE VARIES WITH TIME (0 SAYS
C             IT DOESN'T; 1 SAYS IT DOES)
C     LGRID = 0  USE OLD JPL WAVELENGTH GRID
C     LGRID = 1  USE HIGH RESOLUTION GRID (SEE ALSO GRID.F)
C                IF LGRID=1, IO2 and INO should be set to 2
C     IO2 = 0 FOR ALLEN AND FREDERICK O2 SCHUMANN-RUNGE COEFFICIENTS
C         = 1 FOR EXPONENTIAL SUM FITS (FOR LOW-O2 ATMOSPHERES)
C         = 2 FOR USING HIGH RESOLUTION CROSS SECTION
C     INO = 0 FOR ALLEN AND FREDERICK NO PREDISSOCIATION COEFFICIENTS
C         = 1 FOR MODIFIED CIESLIK AND NICOLET FORMULATION
C         = 2 USE OUT.NOPRATES FILE
C     EPSJ = AMOUNT BY WHICH TO PERTURB THINGS FOR JACOBIAN CALCULATION
C     PRONO  = COLUMN-INTEGRATED NO PRODUCTION RATE FROM LIGHTNING IN
C              EARTH'S PRESENT ATMOSPHERE
C     FRAK = 0  use Mie scattering for hydrocarbon particles
C          = 1  use Fractal scattering for hydrocarbon particles
C     HCDENS = 0.63 g/cm^3 (Archean hydrocarbon density - Trainer et al 2006)
C            = 0.8 g/cm^3 (titan tholins - Trainer et al 2006)
C 	     = 1.0 g/cm^3 (old suspicious default value)
C     ICOUPLE = 0 to turn off coupling / 1 to turn on coupling
C             = 0 to use old formatting (E7.2 for VDEP and FIXEDMR)
C     MONSIZE = 0 for 0.05 um monomers for fractal particles
C      	      = 1 for 0.01 um monomers for fractal particles
C	      = 2 for 0.02 um monomers for fractal particles
C	      = 3 for 0.07 um monomers for fractal particles
C	      = 4 for 0.10 um monomers for fractal particles
C     ZY      = solar zenith angle
